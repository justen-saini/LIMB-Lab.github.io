We are so excited for two of our LIMB Lab students - Jaylon Pascual and Riley Dunn - that have posters at this weekend's Alberta Biomedical Engineering (ABBME) conference in Canmore! Make sure to check out their posters on Saturday afternoon!

Jaylon will be presenting on her Master's work (co-supervised by Dr. Emily Rogers-Bradley), titled "Biomechanical Impact of an Actuated Knee Orthosis – a Pilot Study". Make sure to stop by Jaylon's poster and hear about all the interesting work that she has been doing!

Riley will be presenting his work from this summer, titled "Dual Fluoroscopy Investigation of Joint Kinematics in Ankle Osteoarthritis". Riley did a lot of hard work this summer, you'll want to take a look at his poster to hear all about it!
