Make sure to check out their posters on Saturday afternoon!</p>

<p>Jaylon will be presenting on her Master’s work (co-supervised by Dr. Emily Rogers-Bradley), titled “Biomechanical Impact of an Actuated Knee Orthosis – a Pilot Study”. Make sure to stop by Jaylon’s poster and hear about all the interesting work that she has been doing!</p>

<p>Riley will be presenting his work from this summer, titled “Dual Fluoroscopy Investigation of Joint Kinematics in Ankle Osteoarthritis”. Riley did a lot of hard work this summer, you’ll want to take a look at his poster to hear all about it!</p>]]></content><author><name>LIMB Lab</name></author><category term="conferences" /><category term="McCaig Institute" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are so excited for two of our LIMB Lab students - Jaylon Pascual and Riley Dunn - that have posters at this weekend’s Alberta Biomedical Engineering (ABBME) conference in Canmore!

Sam Chow, Riley Dunn, and Ben Lutzko have all been exceptionally hard working this summer, and contributed a great deal to the research underway in the LIMB Lab this summer! They presented their work at the McCaig Institute Summer Symposium and the Biomedical Engineering Summer Student Symposium. Samantha presented on her study evaluating the biomechanics of ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs), Riley presented his work on changes to osteoarthritic ankle biomechanics in the affected and contralateral ankles, while Ben presented his work on differences in motion capture and dual fluoroscopy when evaluating advanced footwear technology (AFTs). We are so proud of Sam, Riley, and Ben, and are so excited for what they are going to accomplish in the future!</p>

<p>Robert will be presenting his work on the effect of total ankle replacement on ankle joint biomechanics. His study leverages dual fluoroscopy imaging to capture precise in vivo joint kinematics, providing valuable insight into how ankle replacements influence post-operative joint motion. This research is an important step toward improving patient outcomes and refining implant design.</p>

<p>Emily will share her study on the biomechanics of ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs). Her work investigates how different conditions (AFO, SHOD and barefoot) effect joint kinematics during stance phase. By analyzing joint motion, Emily’s research aims to inform better AFO prescriptions tailored to individual gait mechanics.</p>

<p>We are incredibly proud of Robert and Emily for representing the LIMB Lab at such a prestigious international conference. Their work reflects the lab’s commitment to advancing musculoskeletal health through imaging and biomechanics research.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for updates from Sweden — and congratulations to both researchers on this exciting opportunity!</p>]]></content><author><name>Riley Dunn and Samantha Chow</name></author><category term="conferences" /><category term="biomechanics" /><category term="big data" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re excited to announce that two members of the LIMB Lab have been selected to present their research at the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) conference in Sweden this year.]]></summary></entry></feed>
