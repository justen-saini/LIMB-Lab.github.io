**Previous Education:** B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering and a Certificate in Computing from the University of Saskatchewan (Graduated Spring 2023)  

**Pronouns:** He/Him  

**Title/Current Position:** 2nd-year M.Sc. Student in Biomedical Engineering, co-supervised by Dr. Sarah Manske  

**Research:** Justenâ€™s work aims to determine the utility of weight-bearing computed tomography in the study of carpal biomechanics, particularly in the context of scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIL) tears. He is aiming to better understand how load-bearing impacts carpal bone position, as pain under load is a common symptom of SLIL injuries. This work involves measuring 3D carpal alignment, kinematics, and contact patterns between the carpal bones.  

**Hobbies:** Soccer, basketball, and ultimate frisbee
