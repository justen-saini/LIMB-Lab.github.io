# Welcome to the LIMB Lab!

The Locomotion and Imaging for Musculoskeletal Biomechanics Lab is located at the University of Calgary's McCaig Institute, run by Dr. Koren Roach. Our research involves investigating how joint biomechanics, physical activity, and kinematics contribute to the onset and progression of musculoskeletal diseases such as osteoarthritis.

A key proponent of the LIMB Laboratory is the state-of-the-art dual fluoroscopy lab. This system consists of two high-speed video camera, two image intensifiers, and two X-ray sources. This imaging system allows for a precise assessment of dynamic bone translations and rotations.
